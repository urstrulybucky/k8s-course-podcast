    "Working with Pods\n",
    "\n",
    "fundamental Kubernetes object: the Pod. \n",
    "It explores both the theoretical concepts and practical aspects of Pods, \n",
    "explaining their role as the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. \n",
    "Pods encapsulate one or more containers, sharing storage and network resources, \n",
    "and are essential for understanding Kubernetes architecture and operations.\n",

    "Understanding Pods\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Pod Basics: A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object that you can create or deploy. \n",
    "It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Pods encapsulate one or more containers, which means they can run multiple containers that need to work together. \n",
    "These containers share the Podâ€™s storage and network resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Pod Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers: Each container in a Pod runs a specific application or part of an application. \n",
    "Containers in the same Pod can easily communicate with each other using localhost.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Storage: Pods can specify storage resources such as persistent volumes that are shared among all containers in the Pod.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Networking: Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address, and containers within the Pod share the same network namespace.\n",
    "This allows them to communicate with each other directly and efficiently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Lifecycle of a Pod\n",
    "\n",
    "Phases: Pods go through various phases during their lifecycle, including Pending, Running, Succeeded, and Failed. \n",
    "Understanding these phases helps in managing and troubleshooting Pods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Restarts: Kubernetes can restart containers within a Pod if they fail, depending on the defined restart policy (Always, OnFailure, Never).\n",
    "                                                                     \n",
    "Creating and Managing Pods\n",
    "                                                                     \n",
    "Pod Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Manifest Files: Pods are typically defined in YAML or JSON manifest files. \n",
    "These files specify the desired state of the Pod, including the container images, resources, and other configurations.\n",

    "Multi-Container Pods\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful for complex applications requiring multiple processes that need to communicate efficiently. \n",
    "For example, a web server with a sidecar container for logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stateful Applications\n",
    "\n",
